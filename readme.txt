Hey folks!!
I've created my portfolio and I am wishing to add some more details and also want to change the appearance of the website.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know and feel free to contribute to this project because I'm learning web development and getting started with this project is really amazing because I've learnt a lot of new things and I feel like learning web development can be easy only if you start building projects. 
Building projects helps you learn many different things and you get a chance to explore the things and implement it in your own project.
And also the big lesson I learned from this was !!!WIREFRAMING!!! Ohhh God that skill is really amazing when designing any website and it actually helped me in building this project in a very less time!!
